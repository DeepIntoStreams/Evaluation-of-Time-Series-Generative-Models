# Evaluation of Time Series Generative Models

The main objective of the project is to summarize the evaluation metrics used in generative models for synthetic data generation, list advantages and disadvantages of each evaluation metric based on experiments on different datasets and models. We also provide a code pipeline for evaluation of test metrics. 

### Dependencies

Run the following to install all necessary python packages for our code.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Outcomes
- A survey paper;
- A Python code base;
- A database (library) for relevant papers (allow the update from the community).
